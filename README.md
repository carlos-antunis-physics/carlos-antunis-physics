I'm currently an undergraduating student on Bachelor degree in Physics at Universidade Federal de Alagoas - UFAL. Along my graduation I've worked as Scientific Initiation Student on Theoretical Physics, and the employ of Computational Methods to unveil hidden aspects of natural phenomena began to fascinate me. All this marvelous experiences have increased enormously my world view and, as result of it, today I'm an passionate with Computational Physics. As a budding computational physicist I've learned programing languages as `C`, `Fortran`, `MATLAB` and `Python` (besides a few of its modules), having more affinity with programming in `C`.

Since programming can only be learned by actually programming, this repository aim to present some source-codes with valuable concepts on each presented programming language and some interesting algorithms of Computational Physics. In distinction from the others, here I made it available in my native language - Brazilian Portuguese - to facilitate access for interested beginners.

##### [Computational beam optics](https://github.com/carlos-antunis-physics/computational-beam-optics)

![Linguagem Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linguagem%20Python-3572A5?style=plastic)

Understand the effects of an optical medium (even more the non-linear) on the propagation of a light beam are of enormous importance and encompass an inportant source of novel applications. However, provide a general analytical solution which embbed non-linear effects on light propagation is quite difficult (or sometimes impossible). Thus, the computational implementation of numerical methods algorithms of estimation are broadly the approach on the optical phenomena studying.
