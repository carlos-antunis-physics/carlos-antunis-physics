I'm currently a MSc student in Physics at Universidade Federal de Alagoas - UFAL. Along my graduation I've worked as Scientific Initiation Student on Theoretical Physics, and the employ of Computational Methods to unveil hidden aspects of natural phenomena began to fascinate me. All this marvelous experiences have increased enormously my world view and, as result of it, today I'm a Computational Physics passionate. As a budding computational physicist, I've learned programing languages as `C`, `Fortran`, `MATLAB` and `Python` (besides a few of its modules), having more affinity with programming in `C` and `Python`.

Since programming can only be learned by actually programming, this repository aim to present some source-codes with valuable concepts on each presented programming language and some interesting algorithms of Computational Physics. In distinction from the others, here I made it available in my native language - Brazilian Portuguese - to facilitate access for interested beginners.

Understand the effects of an optical medium (even more the non-linear) on the propagation of a light beam are of enormous importance and encompass an inportant source of novel applications. However, provide an analytical method cappable to comprehend this (which embbed possible non-linear effects) is quite difficult (or sometimes impossible) leading to computational approaches. This repository aims to provide a python module with numerical routines to solve partial diferential equations which encompass the optical media effects (even if non-linear) on light propagation. Some examples of usage are disposed in my native language - Brazilian Portuguese - to facilitate learning to interested ones.
