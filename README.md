I'm currently an undergraduate student of Physics on bachelor degree at Federal University of Alagoas - UFAL. Along my graduation I've worked with Computational Physics, firstly, on GPTSBD research group, I've studied atypical events and vibrational transport in low-dimensional disordered systems due to non-linear effects, and nowadays, on GON research group, I've been studying effects on Speckles fields owing to non-linearity of optical media. All this experiences have increase enormously my world view, and as a result of this I'm an passionate with Computational Physics.
