I'm currently an undergraduating student on Bachelor degree in Physics at Federal University of Alagoas - UFAL. Along my graduation I've worked as Scientific Initiation Student on Theoretical Physics, and the employ of Computational Methods to unveil hidden aspects of natural phenomena began to fascinate me. All this marvelous experiences have increased enormously my world view and, as result of it, today I'm an passionate with Computational Physics. As a budding computational physicist I've learned programing languages as `C`, `Fortran`, `MATLAB` and `Python` (besides a few of its modules), having more affinity with programming in `C`.

<!-- Since programming can only be learned by actually programming. This repository aim to present some interesting source-codes that I developed during my path to apprehend valuable concepts and algorithms on Computational Physics. In distinction from the others, here I made it available in my native language - Brazilian Portuguese - to facilitate access for interested beginners. -->
